# 01 - Project Homelab Overview

## 1.1 Executive Summary

This document provides a complete technical and architectural overview of my Homelab project.
It covers hardware configuration, network architecture, Proxmox virtualization, OPNsense routing, VLAN segmentation, issues encountered during implementation, resolutions, troubleshooting workflows, and planned future enhancements.

The lab is designed to:
- provide an isolated penetration testing environment
- integrate a virtualized firewall and router (OPNsense)
- support Proxmox node management via a dedicated management network
- simulate enterprise-grade network segmentation
- host additional systems such as DNS servers, NAS storage, monitoring, and cloud backup infrastructure
- The documentation follows standard internal IT project documentation formats, including architectural diagrams, issue registers, and future roadmap guidance.
